Here is a script and a Makefile for generating a Meson docset for Dash. The script is based on the dash-docset-generation-template

- Meson: https://mesonbuild.com/
- Dash: https://kapeli.com/dash
- dash-docset-generation-template: https://github.com/lshprung/dash-docset-generation-template

To generate a docset from the latest edition of the Meson Manual: 
1. Build an offline copy of the Meson official docs from https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/tree/master/docs by following their instructions.
2. Create a .tar.gz file called `Meson.src.tgz` containing everything from the `built_docs/Meson documentation-doc/html` directory, and place it in the same directory as this README.
	- Do not name it `Meson.tgz` because that is what the packaged Dash docset will be called
3. Now simply execute `make` from the same directory as this README file.

Requirements:

- any POSIX-compliant shell
- curl    - https://curl.se/
- make    - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
